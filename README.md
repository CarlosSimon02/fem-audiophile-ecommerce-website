## 👁️ Overview

### 🏃 The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## 🚛 My process

### ⚙️ Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework used for production
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling
- [React DOM APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom) - I utilize the the createPortal() function for rendering my modal
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For managing form state and validation efficiently
- [React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) - Creating animations when mounting and unmounting components
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - For managing state in a predictable and efficient manner and storing data locally.

### 🖊️ To Do List

- Set up user login: Let users sign up for an account to see their shopping cart on any device.
- Clean up code: Improve the code structure and organization. There's a lot of repetitive code that needs to be simplified and organized better.
